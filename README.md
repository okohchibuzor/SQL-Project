# SQL-Project
Udacity Project: Query a Digital Music Store Database

## Introduction
One of the projects in the Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree was to query the "Chinook Database" for a music store. This project helped me demonstrate my skills in SQL, including using JOINS, COUNT,AVERAGE, SUM and other aggregations. I was able to flex my creative problem-solving skills on this project. 

### About Database
---
The Chinook database holds information about the albums, tracks and customers of a music store as well as details about the store's employees and their invoices. 

### Tool Used
---
Postgres SQL (JOINS, SUM, LIMIT, CONCAT)

### Tasks
---
For the tasks, I came up with four questions.
1. How many tracks are available per media type?
2. Which countries have the highest invoice totals?
3. How many customers are assigned to each support rep?
4. How many tracks are available per genre?
